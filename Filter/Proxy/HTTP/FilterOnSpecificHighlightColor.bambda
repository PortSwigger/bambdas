  /**
   * Filters requests/responses for specific highlight colors

   * You can currently filter requests/responses that are highlighted, but you can't ask Burp to show you requests/responses highlighted with a particular color only. If you use a specific color to categorize requests/responses for role-based authorization testing, todo lists, or identifying a particular browser tab/window then its helpful to be able to see only those requests/resposnse you are interested in. The following Bambda snippet lets you choose the color(s) you want to see. The available colors are:
   * Options:
   * - HighlightColor.BLUE;
   * - HighlightColor.CYAN;
   * - HighlightColor.GRAY;
   * - HighlightColor.GREEN;
   * - HighlightColor.MAGENTA;
   * - HighlightColor.NONE;
   * - HighlightColor.ORANGE;
   * - HighlightColor.PINK;
   * - HighlightColor.RED;
   * - HighlightColor.YELLOW;
   **/

   return requestResponse.annotations().highlightColor().equals(HighlightColor.CYAN);
