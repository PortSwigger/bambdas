## Types of Bambda scripts

Bambdas are scripts that run in supported Burp tools. They enable you to quickly personalize Burp Suite by creating:

- **Table filters** ‚Äì Dynamically filter tables in Burp.
- **Table columns** ‚Äì Add custom table columns to surface important data.
- **Repeater custom actions** ‚Äì Extract, transform, and analyze data in Burp Repeater.
- **Match and replace rules** ‚Äì Replace parts of HTTP and WebSocket messages as they pass through the proxy.
- **Custom scan checks** ‚Äì Create your own active and passive scan checks. This repo contains checks written in Java. For checks written in our BChecks language, see the [BChecks repository](https://github.com/PortSwigger/BChecks).

> üí° You can use table filter scripts in both **Burp Suite Community Edition** and **Burp Suite Professional**. All other scripts require **Burp Suite Professional**.
