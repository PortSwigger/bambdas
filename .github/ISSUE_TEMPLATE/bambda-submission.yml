        Thank you for contributing to the Bambdas repository! ðŸš€

        Please fill out this form to submit your Bambda script. Once submitted, an automated workflow will create a pull request for review.

        **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Drag and drop your `.bambda` file here, or click to browse and attach it.

        **Option 2**: Paste the complete content of your exported `.bambda` file below.

        **Important**:
        - Export your script from Burp's Bambda library to ensure correct YAML format
        - The file must include ALL required fields: `id`, `name`, `function`, `location`, and `source`
        - The `name` field will be automatically converted to camel case for the filename
          - E.g., "My Custom Script" â†’ `MyCustomScript.bambda`
          - Non-alphanumeric characters will be stripped
        - The `source` must contain a Javadoc comment with description and `@author` tag

        Example format:
        ```yaml
        id: 48d6a6bb-3675-a171-5cb6-1a72355ce71a
        name: My Custom Script
        function: VIEW_FILTER
        location: PROXY_HTTP_HISTORY
